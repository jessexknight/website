abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Good CTA collaterals independently predict good outcome in acute ischemic stroke. Our aim was to evaluate the role of collateral circulation and its added benefit over CTP-derived total ischemic volume as a predictor of baseline NIHSS score, total ischemic volume, hemorrhagic transformation, final infarct size, and a modified Rankin Scale score {\textgreater}2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 395 patients with stroke dichotomized by recanalization (recanalization positive/recanalization negative) and collateral status. Clot burden score was quantified on baseline CTA. Total ischemic volumes were derived from thresholded CTP maps. Final infarct size was assessed on follow-up CT/MRI. We performed uni-/multivariate analyses for each outcome, adjusting for rtPA status, using general linear (continuous variables) and logistic (binary variables) regression. Model comparison with collateral score and total ischemic volume was performed using the F or likelihood ratio test. RESULTS: Collateral presence independently and inversely predicted all outcomes except hemorrhagic transformation in patients who were recanalization negative and mRS {\textgreater}2 in patients who were recanalization positive. The greatest collateral benefit occurred in patients who were recanalization negative, contributing 16.5{\%} and 19.2{\%} of the variability for final infarct size and mRS {\textgreater}2. The collateral score model is superior to the total ischemic volume for mRS {\textgreater}2 prediction, but a combination of total ischemic volume and collateral score is superior for mRS {\textgreater}2 and final infarct prediction (24{\%} and 28{\%} variability, respectively). In patients who were recanalization positive, a model including collateral score and total ischemic volume was superior to that of total ischemic volume for hemorrhagic transformation and final infarct prediction but was muted compared with patients who were recanalization negative (11.3{\%} and 16.9{\%} variability). CONCLUSIONS: Collateral circulation is an independent predictor of all outcomes, but the magnitude of significance varies, greater in patients who were recanalization negative versus recanalization positive. Total ischemic volume assessment is complementary to collateral score in many cases.},

abstract = {We sought to quantify CTP-derived infarct core applying previously published perfusion thresholds to multi-institutional CTP data to assess the margin of error for 25 mL and 70 mL critical volume thresholds using early DWI as a reference standard. 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing CTP and DWI within 6 and 24 h of symptom onset, respectively, were retrospectively analyzed from 3 tertiary care centers. CTP-derived infarct core was calculated using published thresholds for absolute and relative CBF and CBV in addition to manual CBV tracing. Using DWI as the reference standard, performance of CTP-derived measures of infarct core was assessed using co-registered voxel-by-voxel analysis and total infarct volume comparison. Volumes of each CTP infarct core estimate were compared against DWI to determine the degree of infarct core over or underestimation at the critical volumes of 25 mL and 70 mL. Median core infarct volume was 10.8 mL. Mean CTP-derived infarct core volumes were similar to DWI for all CTP threshold methods to within Â± 1 mL. CBV tracing demonstrated an overall significant core overestimation compared to DWI (p = 0.017). All CTP core volume estimations showed robust correlation with DWI (Pearson p-value {\textless} 0.001). As core volume increased, CTP demonstrated increased deviation from DWI. At the critical cut-offs of 25 mL and 70 mL, relative CBF demonstrated the best agreement with DWI for infarct core compared to the other CTP-derived measures of infarct core. Our study demonstrates close approximation between multiple CTP-derived measures of infarct core and DWI infarct volume, Especially relative CBF.},

abstract = {There have been many efforts to automate segmentation of MS lesions in brain MRI, since human delineation is time consuming and error prone. However, most existing methods require multiple coregistered MR sequences, tissue priors or parametric models, and are rarely validated on multi-scanner image databases. In this work, a fast, FLAIR-only lesion segmentation algorithm is proposed, that does not use tissue priors or parametric models. The method uses an edge-based model of partial volume averaging to estimate fuzzy membership profiles of tissue classes. Results are further refined using an upstream image standardization pipeline, and downstream post processing. Lesion segmentation performance is measured on 15 volumes from three different scanners, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.},
